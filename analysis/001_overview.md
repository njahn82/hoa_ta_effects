What are the number and proportion of open access articles in hybrid
journals published under a transformative agreement?

Between 2018 and 2022, a total of 11,171 out of 12,681 hybrid journals
in transformative agreements published at least one open access article
under a Creative Commons license. During this period, these hybrid
journals provided open access to 747,238 out of 8,174,722 articles,
representing a five-year open access proportion of 9.1%. Authors who
could make use of transformative agreements at the time of publication
contributed 320,682 open access articles to the total.

Figure 2A shows a moderate growth in the proportion of open access
articles in hybrid journals, comparing the overall open access uptake
and the impact of transformative agreements on this trend. Over the
five-years period from 2018 to 2022, open access increased from 4.3% (n
= 66,154) to 15% (n = 250,804). At the same time, the total article
volume of the investigated journals grew from 1,533,372 in 2018 to
1,680,807 in 2022.

Figure 2B highlights that the majority of open access articles in hybrid
journals were made available through transformative agreements in 2021
and 2022, contributing 55% of the total open access article volume in
2022. However, there was also a notable growth in open access provision
through individual publication fees, which increased from 4.1% (n =
63,334) in 2018 to 6.7% (n = 111,858). This suggests that publishers
were able to gain equally from individual and institutional open access
publishing options.

Figure 2C depicts the substantial variations among the hybrid journals
included in transformative agreements in terms of open access uptake.
Although the median generally follows the trend shown in Figure 2A, the
farther stretch of upper quartiles and whiskers over the years
illustrates that an increasing number of journals published an
above-average proportion of open access articles. In 2022, 25% of hybrid
journals (n = 2,568) had an open access uptake of 29%, and 6.6% of
journals (n = 742) provided the majority of their articles under a
Creative Commons license in the same year. These journals were, on
average, smaller (M = 77, SD = 189) than those with an open access share
below 50% (M = 165, SD = 347). Notable exception of large journals with
an above-average open access proportion were Physical Review D, a
high-energy physics journal covered by the SCOAP3 consortium that
provided open access to 2,341 out of 4,074 articles in 2022, Astronomy
and Physics (1,396 out of 2,230 articles in 2022 were open access),
which shifted to a subscribe to open business model for all accepted
articles as of April 2022, the Journal of Fluid Mechanics (577 of 1,077
articles in 2022 were open access) and Bioinformatics (405 out of 777
articles in 2022 were open access), which flipped to full open access as
of January 2023.

When comparing the impact of open access trough transformative
agreements across journals, it shows that for many journals these
agreements substantially contributed to the growth of open access over
the years (Figure 2D). Examples of such journals include those with a
scope on specific countries or regions, where also transformative
agreements were implemented. For instance, in 2022, the Germany-based
journals Zeitschrift für Erziehungswissenschaft and Zeitschrift für
Politikwissenschaft, as well as the Scandinavian Political Studies
adressing the Nordic countries, achieved an overall open access uptake
of more than 90% just through transformative agreements. Despite the
rise in transformative agreements, it is worth noting that other means
of publishing open access in hybrid journals remained common. In total,
9,223 journals published open access articles from authors affiliated
with institutions without transformative agreements in place, while
8,715 journals published at least one open access article through a
transformative agreement in the same year.

Analysing hybrid open access across publishers between 2018 and 2022
reveals a large market concentration. Although 47 publishers offered
transformative agreements, the big three commercial publishers Elsevier,
Springer Nature, and Wiley, accounted for 50% of total article volume
published (see Table ). Together, they published 503,460 open access
articles, representing 67% of the open access articles in hybrid
journals. Elsevier, Springer Nature, and Wiley made 236,027 articles
open access in hybrid journals through transformative agreements,
resulting in an even larger market share of 73%. However, there are
differences among the three large publishers. Although Elsevier
published the largest volume of articles (n = 2,788,990, 34%), it
published a relatively low number of open access articles, including
those that can be associated with transformative agreements. In
contrast, Springer Nature and Wiley provided open access to a larger
proportion of their articles (13% of Springer Nature articles and 15% of
Wiley articles were open acccess), leading to higher open access market
shares (23% Springer Nature resp. 23% Wiley). This difference between
Elsevier on the one hand and Springer Nature and Wiley on the other can
be attributed to transformative agreements, as the latter made the
majority of their open access articles available through such deals
(Springer Nature 56% resp. Wiley 55%).

Figure 2 takes a closer look into the growth of hybrid open access
across publishers by year with a focus on open articles enabled by
transformative agreements. Although all publishers show a general
long-term trend towards transformative agreements, Figure 2A and 2B
indicate that, in particular, the open access share of Wiley’s hybrid
journal portfolio quadrupled from 5.8% in 2018 to 26% in 2022 as a
result of these agreements. In comparison, the proportion of open access
articles Elsevier hybrid journals grew from from 3.3% in 2018 to 10% in
2022. Unlike the other two publishers, Springer Nature started early to
offer selected consortia open access agreements for its hybrid journal
portfolio (“Springer Compact”). Data about the Springer compact
agreements with large consortia including Max Planck Society, the
Swedish Bibsam consortium qnd the Finish FinELib consortium that ended
before start of the trnasofrmative agreement data collection in June
2021. 8.4% Springer Nature excelled in 2018, but gained a slower growth
than Wiley, resulting into 18% of all articles being open access in
Springer Nature hybrid journals in 2022.

published the less than half of its 61,620 open access articles in 2022
through transformative agreements (48%). while 64% of Springer Nature’s
grew slower in the last year compared to Wiley, and 69% of Wiley’s open
access articles could be linked to transformative agreements in 2022.
Overall, Wiley published the largest number of open access articles from
transformative agreements in 2022 (n = 54,753), followed by Springer
Nature (54,753) and Elsevier (54,753). This varying focus resulted into
an different overall open access proportion in 2022 – only 10% of all
articles in Elsevier hybrid journals were open access in 2022, compared
to published in springer nautre and xx in Wiley hybrid journals.

The increasing impact of open access through transofmrative agreements
can be also obsevered at the journal-level (Figure 2). While no
substantial differences between open access enabled through
transformative agreements can be seen across Elsevier journals, an
growing number of hybrid journals published by Springer Nature and Wiley
increased their open access share through these agreements. In 2022, 25%
of Springer Nature hybrid journal portfolio comprised journals with an
open access proportion of percent, while Wiley.
